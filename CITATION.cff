  This offline transcription editor is designed to highlight
  the differences between two transcriptions of New
  Testament manuscripts. It works with plain text
  transcriptions and XML transcriptions that follow the
  IGNTP specifications. It is only designed to compare
  differences within a biblical verse although verse order
  is compared and reported separately.
